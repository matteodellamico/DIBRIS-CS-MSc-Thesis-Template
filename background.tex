\chapter{Background}
\label{sec:background}

This chapter provides the necessary background information to understand your thesis' content.
The goal is to make your thesis \emph{self-contained}: the reader, who you can assume will be
a fellow Computer Science student, should be able to understand your work without having to refer
to external sources. Of course, you should reference the sources you used to write this chapter
and references to documents that the reader can use to know more about those topics.

Don't include information that is not necessary to understand your work. If something is
complementary to your work, but not necessary to understand it, you can include it in the
Related Work chapter (\Cref{sec:related}).

The Background chapter contains information about work that \emph{you didn't do}. The work you
did should be decscribed in the Methodology chapter (\Cref{sec:method}) instead.

The amount of information you will need to present in this Chapter can vary a lot between theses.
In some cases, you will have no or very little need for a Background chapter; in that case, it
may make sense to move this information to a section in the Related Work chapter.
